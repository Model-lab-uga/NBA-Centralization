# NBA-Centralization
This project aims to explore the passing network patterns of National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. Specifically, the project seeks to answer the following questions:

1. How do network patterns change over time?
2. What drives network pattern changes over time?
* How do coaches impact team temporal centralizations?
* How do teams react to injuries
  * How does the centrality of an invididual team member relate to how teams react following player transtion? (injury, trade, etc)
  * How might collective centrality of multiple players impact team adaptation?
3. What types of network metrics are most predictive of team success outcomes?
4. What are the relationships between network temporal patterns and team behavioral indicators?
